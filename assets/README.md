This readme will have all the information about the sites and information about what is changed in each update.

#Initial Idea
3 Sections - A callout section with a button, A quote section with customer feedback and a feature section with a few key features of the service.

##v0.1 - Callout Added
The callout was added to the index page, at the moment this is simple structure with only information, this is currently for mobile view and will be stlyed for that later then adapted for tablet and computer.

##v0.11 - Quote Added
The Quotes section was added with a few mock reviews, also the classes to style later where added to the style.css.

##v0.12 - Feature Added
The feature section was added and again the css updated with classes to be styled later.

##v0.13 - Visual Update
Some of the text has been rearranged and sytled for better effect on the reader. 
Heading changed to uppercase so they are clear and understandable. 
Change quotes to blockquotes so they look better and called blockquotes from bootstrap.
Added read more buttons to the features section to link to more about each comment and to lead to more comments.
Finally added a button under the ential callout for sign up. 

##v0.2 - Change Grid Design
When the screen is at a medium width the callout will be a 12 row, the quote header will be a 12 row and the feature header will be a 12 row. Then the quotes and features will be 6 rows.
Then when the screen is at a large width the features will change to a 4 row, this should be the only change between them.
Also rearranged code so that it was more tidy and clearly organised.

##v0.21 - Adding Navigation
The Navigation was added to the top of the page, along with a company slogan and a sign in/sign up link. 
This Navigation goes to a about page and the home page. 
Also when resoultion gets to a phone size the sign up/sign in will disapear for view on the top bar and join as a link on the Navigation bar.
Added some spacing to the headers of each other section, leaving the callout how it was.
Finally we turned the Callout into a jumbotron look and changed the alignment of the text on it and made it so that the price disapears on lower resoultion for better flow.

##v0.22 - Images Added For Quotes
In this version the images for the quotes had been added so that when in any view higher than mobile you could see two images, one female and one male, incased in circles next to the quotes.

##v0.23 - Adding Alert
In this version a alert has been added which informs the customers of a sale that is currently going on, although this wont show on the mobile as it takes a lot of needed screen space.
There are also some minor changes to things in the html code.

##v0.24 - Navigation Change
The view of the Navigation on the mobile has been changed to a drop down menu with some whiskey choices added.

##v0.25 - Sign Up Model
A model was added to respond to the sign up button on the callout. When this opens it will create a box over the screen which askes for a email, password and a repeat password.
It will also say that we will never share your email with anyone.

##v0.3 - Finishing CSS
There is a lot changed in this one, the html has been moved and changed to work with the new CSS rules that have been applied in the style.css document.
The main changes is styling the structure so that it all flows better, adding color and fonts so liven up the page and grab the users attention.
Also correcting the issues with the images not loading from the Img folder.
Added a background for the callout area.
Fixed the issue with the navigation not responded how expected, the words will now highlight when selected and the dropdown menu works as intended now.
