This readme will have all the information about the sites and information about what is changed in each update.

#Initial Idea
3 Sections - A callout section with a button, A quote section with customer feedback and a feature section with a few key features of the service.

##v0.1 - Callout Added
The callout was added to the index page, at the moment this is simple structure with only information, this is currently for mobile view and will be stlyed for that later then adapted for tablet and computer.

##v0.11 - Quote Added
The Quotes section was added with a few mock reviews, also the classes to style later where added to the style.css.

##v0.12 - Feature Added
The feature section was added and again the css updated with classes to be styled later.

##v0.13 - Visual Update
Some of the text has been rearranged and sytled for better effect on the reader. 
Heading changed to uppercase so they are clear and understandable. 
Change quotes to blockquotes so they look better and called blockquotes from bootstrap.
Added read more buttons to the features section to link to more about each comment and to lead to more comments.
Finally added a button under the ential callout for sign up.
